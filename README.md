## ORM framework
We used ORM as the base idea in our project design. Object-relational mapping (ORM, O/RM, and O/R mapping tool) in computer science is a programming technique for converting data between incompatible type systems using object-oriented programming languages. This creates, in effect, a "virtual object database" that can be used from within the programming language. There are both free and commercial packages available that perform object-relational mapping, although some programmers opt to construct their own ORM tools.

## AngularJS
AngularJS is a JavaScript framework. It can be added to an HTML page.AngularJS extends HTML attributes with Directives and binds data to HTML with Expressions. In our chat room, we used the angularjs framework, being able to bind data, using different controllers on the front-and.
